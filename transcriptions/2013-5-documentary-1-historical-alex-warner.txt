The battle of Britain was one of the most harrowing episodes of the entire second world war. Seeking to deal a knockout blow after successfully conquering much of continental Europe, Hitler unleashed the Luftwaffe against Britain, which after the fall of Paris in June of 1940, stood virtually alone against the Nazi onslaught. Hitler sought to neutralize British air defenses in preparation for an invasion of Britain by sea. Yet despite attacking Britain through the air with overwhelming force, Hitler underestimated the resolve of the British people. The panels of the monument commemorate the contributions of Britons from all walks of life, from the observers who watch the sky for German planes, to the anti aircraft gunners and ground crews, to the women working in factories and directing the squadrons in the air, and of course, the pilots themselves, who seemed to spring into action out of the wall in this panel.
